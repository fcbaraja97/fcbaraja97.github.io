                His family
            </h1>
            <p class="active">
                His family consists of his fiance, 3 dogs, and 5 cats. These are all former strays he and his wife fostered and went on to adopt as they frequently trap and spay local strays in an effort to reduce the number of strays in their neighborhood. The thought of animals be subjected to a life of starvation and pain is more than enough inspiration for the both of them to devote their time and resources into improving their community.
