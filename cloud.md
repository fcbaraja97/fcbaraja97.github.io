# Prior Cloud Knowledge

## I am have a very baseline knowledge of cloud but I have substantially less knowledge of cloud computing. I use cloud storage for my phone and some other things like videogames and such but I don't really understand how it works but I'm looking forward to the video.

# First 10 minutes of the video

Cloud computing has a ton of applications such as:

<!--
- Music storage
- File management
- E-reader
-->

## These are just a few uses and I often take advantage of this technology without even realizing it. Cloud is essentially a collectionn of data centers that make sure you can manage and access your files more quickly. It lets you 'rent' services and save money by doing so.

## Cloud Computing

<!--
-Cloud computing is the storage, processing, and accessing of data/applications on remote servers and via the internet. It allows for worldwide access to your data and allows the freedom of accessing that data how you want to.
-->

## It's very interesting to learn about this because it gives me better perspective on the scope opf cloud computing. It truly encompasses the world (at least the parts with Wi-Fi).

## Service models

<!--
- IaaS
-- Infrastructure as a Service provides:
--- Virtual computing resources over the internet
--- Don't have to worry about the physical machine
-- This means that an underlying sturcture is given to the user which allows them to choose their os and what applications they want to use.
- PaaS
-- Platform as a Service is a space where you can design your own applications using programming languages and place them on the cloud server for others to consume.
- Saas
-- SaaS or Software as a Service is a cloud provider that leases applications/software which are owned by them to its client.
--- The example in the video given is Gmail and that helped my understanding a little better. This model is mainly one which the user only has to worry about consuming the service.
-->

## The graphic provided by the video painted a clear picture of the workflow of each service model.

## Deployment Models

<!--
- Private Cloud
-- Limited number of people offered hosted services behind firewall which minimizes security concerns. Private cloud gives companies control over data.
- Public Cloud
-- The service provider gives resources, like applications and storage for the general public use over the internet.
-- It is easy and inexpensive to get running as the hardware, app and bandwidth costs are covered by the provider
-- You pay for what you use.
- Hybrid Cloud
-- This is a combination of both Private and Public Cloud models.
-- It gives an environment which uses a mix of both services.
-- The best of both worlds!
-->

## These deployment models are the basics of this concept and this concept is essentially the playground you choose for your applications and wether or not they are public or private or both.

## Cloud providers

There are a lot of these but a few of them are:

<!--
- Google Cloud Platform
- Amazon Web Services
- Microsoft Azure
-->

Amazon apparently has 6 times the size of any of the cloud providers. Pricing is a big part of their dominance but also the head start they had on everyone else still yields advantages.

# The last portion of the video

## AWS

This cloud provider offers a free tier for a year with certain restrictions. This allows users to experience this service and make a more informed opinion on wether they want to pay for the service. He walks us throught the process that aws has in place when creating an instance.

## Google cloud platform

This provider has a lot of similarities to aws but the difference is the pricing because you have to be careful about your billing preferences. He also goes over a few of the ui differences as well as where to create an instance.

# In Summation

This video taught me what cloud computing is and how it works on a deeper level. I didn't know about most of the topics covered like how there are different service providers and the differences between them. I have a much more in depth understanding about this topic now.
